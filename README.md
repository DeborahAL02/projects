# Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository contains projects developed as part of my coursework and practice in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The main goal of these projects is to demonstrate a clear understanding and practical application of core OOP concepts, the **SOLID principles**, and **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations.

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Used

The projects in this repository are designed using Object-Oriented Programming principles learned in class, including:

* **Classes and Objects** – Code is structured around classes that represent real-world entities, with objects created from those classes.
* **Encapsulation** – Data and methods are grouped together, with controlled access using access modifiers.
* **Inheritance** – Child classes extend parent classes to promote code reuse and logical hierarchy.
* **Abstraction** – Abstract classes and/or interfaces are used to define common behavior while hiding implementation details.
* **Polymorphism** – Methods are overridden or implemented differently across related classes to allow flexible behavior.

## Arrays and Data Handling

* **Arrays** are used to store and manage collections of objects and data efficiently.
* Iteration over arrays is applied to perform operations such as searching, updating, and displaying data.

## SOLID Principles

The projects follow the **SOLID design principles** to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code:

* **Single Responsibility Principle** – Each class has a clear and focused responsibility.
* **Open/Closed Principle** – Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
* **Liskov Substitution Principle** – Subclasses can replace their parent classes without breaking functionality.
* **Interface Segregation Principle** – Interfaces are designed to be specific and relevant to the classes that implement them.
* **Dependency Inversion Principle** – High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## CRUD Operations

CRUD functionality is implemented to manage application data:

* **Create** – Add new records or objects.
* **Read** – Retrieve and display stored data.
* **Update** – Modify existing records or object data.
* **Delete** – Remove records or objects when no longer needed.

These operations demonstrate how OOP concepts work together with basic data management logic.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Practice and demonstrate OOP concepts learned in class
* Apply SOLID principles in real code
* Show understanding of arrays and CRUD operations
* Build a strong foundation for larger, real-world software projects
